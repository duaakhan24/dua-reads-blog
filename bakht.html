                          <h2> Review:</h2>
                          <p class="post-text">
                          I've been seeing a lot of hype around Bakht by Mehrunisa Shahmeer, so I decided to give it a shot. Honestly, it was a mixed bag for me.
                          The book is a mix of emotions, thatâ€™s for sure.
                          <br>The story started off strong. I was really into Halay's character.
Halay, the main character, is a strong woman, but sometimes her decisions were like, "Girl, what are you thinking?" I get that she's going through a lot, but some of her choices were just...wild.<br>

 <br>She's feisty and independent, which is refreshing. But as the story progressed, I felt like it dragged a bit. Some parts felt repetitive, and I found myself skipping pages.Umer Hayat, oh boy, he's a complex character. I liked him, hated him, then liked him again. It was a rollercoaster. Haroon, well, he's the typical good guy, you know?<br>

<br>The love triangle was okay, I guess. It's a classic trope, but it worked here. Umer Hayat is definitely a complex character, and I couldn't quite figure him out. Haroon, well, he's the safe choice.

The ending was a surprise, I'll give it that. It wasn't what I expected at all. But it left me with a lot of questions.
The story is good, don't get me wrong, but it dragged a bit in the middle. I found myself skimming through a few parts. The ending was okay, I guess. Not exactly what I expected.<br></p>
