                          “Sulphite” is not merely a novel; it is an exploration of the human condition, a journey through the complexities of life, and a celebration of the art of storytelling. Noor Rajpoot has not only penned a captivating tale but has also crafted a work that invites introspection and contemplation. The novel prompts readers to reflect on their own lives, relationships, and the intricacies that make us human.<br>
                          <br>An interesting read, the discussions were beautiful,holding religious as well as philosophical and scientific aspects on certain topics, opening and character development was great 
                          I kind of am angry because one of my fav characters dies in the book. I didnt know he was my fav until I read his death scene.
                          Mahi and Hisham will forever stay in my heart

                          <br>I didn’t find it similar to peer-e-kamil, I mean okay there were little déjà vu scenes but just because it was based on “coming towards Islam” trope it doesn’t make it “peer-e-kamil” ki copy.</p>
