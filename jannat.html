          <h2> Review:</h2>
           <p class="post-text">This book is full of surprises. Every time a secret is revealed, I screamed—sometimes with happiness and sometimes because of the suspense. The story keeps you guessing with unexpected events.
           Nemrah does a great job explaining the importance of wearing the veil (pardah) and the challenges women face to keep their hijab. Even though it’s fiction, it feels very real.
           Haya is a very strong and inspiring character. She fights her battles alone, which is really impressive. At first, I didn’t understand why everyone loves Jihan Sikander (if you know the memes), but by the end, I became a fan too. His character growth is amazing.
          This is one of those books that you can’t put down until you finish it, and then you can’t stop thinking about it because it feels like a dream world.</p>
