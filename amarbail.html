                          Amar Bail by Umera Ahmed is a gripping Urdu novel about love, family, and societal pressures. It follows Umar Jahangir and Aleezay Sikandar as they find love amidst corruption, power struggles, and the impact of parental mistakes in Pakistan's bureaucratic culture.
                          
                
                          <h2> Review:</h2>
                          <p class="post-text">
                          The story perfectly shows the lust of power and status, the dark side of elite class, the flaws of bureaucracy, the cheapest mindsets of strong people, the godfather system of military over democracy, the game of dark evils in our social system, dirty politics, weak judiciary and much more about our corrupt system. <br>
                          <br>But still I'm speechless for the character of Umer Jahangir like he was imperfectly perfect ... This story also shows that it's very hard to live with broken marriages of your parents and most specially selfishness of parents can completely destroy your inner core and your inner-self despite of the fact either you're a strong bureaucrat like Umer Jahangir or a immature teenager like Alizeh Sikandar.<br>
                          <br> The tale of true love left uncompleted, Umer doesn't deserve death, though Alizeh is a week character doesn't evolve as a strong mature girl even though Umer had worked a lot on her to make her mature but still she also don't deserve that much pain... I as a reader want to know more about Umer Jahangir's love side, about the reason of his death and the reaction of Alizeh after knowing his love for her, the story left uncompleted as the death of Umer Jahangir left me completely shocked, while reading that part it was very painful.<br>
                          <br> Although it's just a story but this story has bucket full of emotions, thrills, feelings, love, joy, sadness, tears and much more... This story has made me realise self-worth and to think rationally about my responsibilities as a part of this system... Outstanding read.</p>

                               <b>Umar Jahangir: </b> The male protagonist, son of a corrupt bureaucrat, who finds himself entangled in a web of family complexities and societal pressures.<br>
                              <b>Aleezay Sikandar:</b>   The female protagonist, an introverted young woman grappling with a broken family and personal insecurities.<br>
                                These two characters form the core of the novel, their lives intertwining as they navigate through challenges, love, and loss.
