          Namal, a captivating Urdu novel by Nemrah Ahmed, is a story deeply rooted in Islamic teachings and the human spirit. The title itself, "Namal," translates to "ants," symbolizing the often overlooked and underestimated individuals who play a pivotal role in society.

The novel delves into the complexities of human nature, exploring themes of faith, love, loss, and redemption. It weaves together multiple storylines, each character's journey contributing to the overarching narrative. Nemrah Ahmed's writing style is characterized by its eloquence and ability to evoke a wide range of emotions in readers.

Central to the novel is the exploration of the Quranic Surah Namal, which serves as a spiritual and moral compass for the characters. The story unfolds against the backdrop of contemporary Pakistani society, highlighting both its challenges and its resilience.
            
      <h2> Review:</h2>
      <p class="post-text">Naml by Nemrah Ahmed is one of the best Urdu novels that I’ve ever read. Let me tell you: This is hands down Nemrah Ahmad’s finest work to date.
<br>
This is basically a revenge story. On one side we have the good guys, the Yousafs and the Ghazi clan and on the other side, the Kardars. The head of the Kardar family, Hashim, murders the wife and brother of Faris Ghazi in an attempt to cover up his wrongdoings and thus begins the cycle of revenge. This book is not so much plot driven as it is character driven.The character development throughout the novel is truly inspiring and aspirational. The story revolves around the characters Saadi, Haneen, Zumar and Faris and their individual struggle for what they think is right.<br>

<br>The book is divided into three parts each containing ten chapters and every chapter has a title of its own starting with ‘Humara Saadi’ and ending with ‘Idus Martiae Abhi Beetay Nahi’. I read this novel episodically as it was published in the digest. This novel was life changing for me in so many ways, it completely changed my mind and way of thinking.<br>

<br>This book deserves all the praise and appreciation in the world…
This story explores multiple themes, reveals horrible bitter truths, portrays the cycle of revenge,shed light on the injustice reigning in our systems and pretty accurately depicting the power dynamics but with all these dark themes- this books shows us a ray of hope, helps understand how important but how hard it is to speak against wrong and in doing so it establishes that good will always win but this ‘ winning’ can be in several different forms.<br>

<br>Moving on, what adds more to this book is the brilliant cast of characters- Faris, Zumar, Saadi, Hashim, Hannen, Jawahirat, - all of them with their well developed personalities, fighting their own wars and having their own character arc, made this story way more special then it already was.<br>

Zumar has to be my favourite female protagonists, with her boss girl attitude and her bruised heart, she was a queen in her own sense, fighting this battle of justice valiantly.
Faris, his battle and suffering was the most heartbreaking but his revenge was the most satisfying<br></p>
