                        <p class="post-text">
                            Mushaf follows the life of Mehmal, an orphaned girl who finds solace and strength in the Quran. Her father's untimely death leaves her vulnerable to the machinations of her greedy relatives, who seize their family's wealth. Mehmal's world is turned upside down as she grapples with poverty, loss, and the betrayal of those closest to her.

                            The story is a poignant exploration of Mehmal's journey as she navigates the complexities of life while seeking guidance from the Quran. Her unwavering faith becomes her beacon of hope amidst the darkness. The novel delves into themes of family, friendship, love, and the power of spirituality to overcome adversity.
                          
                
                          <h2> Review:</h2>
                          <p class="post-text">
                          The plot of the story was not very unconventional as there were many times when you were made to think of the scenes of a typical Pakistani drama where girls are shamelessly beaten and abused by their families for the unjust inheritance of wealth. The end in that way was also typical where the old yet a proud mother is shown who is extremely happy at how her young son has grown up to be while the rest of the family reaps the sown seeds of abuse as each one of them faces the wrath of nature.<br>
                          <br>However, what made an impression on me the most was how the author connected the life of Mehmal with Quran and it became her source of facing the hardest of hardships that she had to face. Quran became more like a guide for her to assist her on every single decision and a source of attaining patience and her peace with Almighty.<br>
                          <br>On a more personal note, the book with its end has really pushed me to approach the Holy Quran from a different angle to achieve guidance and not just recite for the sake of it. This book has altered the way I used to look at the world. This book has taught me how to read Qur'an and understand it by finding messages hidden in between the lines. I never thought of Qur'an 'Talking' to us before, but now I know that Allah SWT gives us little signals in the form of Ayaat everytime we stray from the straight path. I loved the main concept and how such an amazing message is interwoven with the life of an everyday person. Good Job Nimra Ahmad. We need more books like this one.<br>
                          <br>"Dunya kaam ki jaga hai, qabr araam ki aur janaah inaam ki"how well does this fits on mush'af and it's storyline.</p>
