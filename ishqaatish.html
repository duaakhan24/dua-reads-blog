                          Ishq Aatish is a poignant Urdu novel by Sadia Rajpoot that delves into themes of love, sacrifice, and the complexities of human relationships. 
        
                          <h2> Review:</h2>
                        <p class="post-text">  This book is phenomenal!!!
Honestly I don't have words to describe about the book. It's just perfect!
It's a tale of three people, Noor-ul-huda, Maliha and Wajdaan! (I don't wanna give any other info, coz I want people to dive into this because as it is w/o any other info)<br>

<br>The Writing is BEAUTIFUL! The dialogues are simple yet tugs the heart strings so badly, ohmy, I was on the verge of crying many times while reading this. (I can't believe it's her first novel, and also amazed that how come I haven't heard about her before inspite of reading so much Urdu fix, anyways, der aaye durust aaye, Imma search about other novels of hers too) edit: am here after searching for other books,but sadly,very sadly, there's no other book written by her, it's her first and last as of now!<br>

<br>The storytelling is almost perfect (there's only one track in the story which I thought wasn't needed much) apart from that the flow, the speed, the mystery, all on point.

The topics which writer raised in the topics were so subtly raised, with so much sensitivity, it never felt an extra info! (Really Appreciate the writer there, coz many authors esp in Urdu can't do it this easily/subtly)
Another thing which I really loved was the realistic(ness) of the story, of characters and their dialogues, never even once I felt it's over the top or unrealistic novel type dialogue happening among characters, it was done so right!<br>

What else... I loved everything about this book period. And if you haven't read it yet. GOOOO AND READ IT! You've such a nice treat ahead of you, I wish I can forget it and read it again! Anyways, you get the point how much I loved this one! Go read now!<br>


<br><b>Spoiler PLEASE DON'T READ THIS BEFORE READING THE BOOK</b> .I am writing this here coz I wanna remember how much I loved this part of book.

I really really loved the scenes between wajdaan and Noor-ul-huda, right from beginning when they were pretty small, like when he comes on stage and scream haadi Bhai me aap se yeh nhi kahuga ke use khush rakhna kyu ki me jaanta hu ke aap use sab se zyada khush rakhoge! (Me waari jao iss scene par ) in this age ,where lovers loose their temper when they see a rival in their love,this man knows that he loves him genuinely and he's screaming on top of his lungs saying congrats to him, take a bow author, I'm impressed, totally!<br>
<br>And then when they meet after all those years, where both of them want apology from each one of them, how much respect and love they had for each other coz they knew their lover was in love with the other person. How wajdaan remembered her last dialogues about haadi, and has no negative emotions about him, coz woh uski mohabbat ki mohabbat tha this is what love is, this is what I always searched in books. Love is about giving, totally!
So yeah I really loved that scene, I stopped while reading that scene and thought, wait, these two men, both who loved one girl so deeply, and here they are hugging each other, last where have I ever seen this kind of relationship? Woahh! I think I'll take pretty good amount of time from getting out of this book. Pheww, enough for now, otherwise I can keep going on and one.<br>
<br>Okay but last thing, there sooo many memorable dialogues, but this one which was so simple and the way and moment in which it was said, I loved it. It's my favourite dialogue out of whole book " Ab toh mujhe tang karna chodo, dekho meri dulhan bhi Hans rahi hai mujh pe" (After reading the dialogue, le me to author: "teri le le balaye, tere sadqe utare)
Goodness, I've never written a review this emotionally, lol, I've just written whatever came in my mind, without editing or re-reading anything, but I don't regret it either! (So thanks if you read it till here, my emotional review, ) and if you've read the book, I'd love to know your thoughts, discuss it with you.<br>

<br>Read it if you want a good cry.
Though the book is heart wrenching but I am still satisfied and glad that I picked it. Author penned down the emotions and characters perfectly.
Love it.</p>
