                          Maala by Nemrah Ahmed is a gripping Urdu novel about love, loss, and resilience. It follows Kashmala, a strong-willed protagonist, as she faces unexpected challenges. Blending tradition with modernity, the story explores deep emotions and complex relationships.
                
                          <h2> Review:</h2>
                          <p class="post-text">
                          <br>Reviewing after 19 episodes;
                          This is the world of necromensis.Ofcourse as always nemrah won the hearts of many peeps through the characterization of characters,twists,plots and many more♥️
                          
                          <br>Nemrah doesn't heal the characters after sufferings I thinks it's me who is healing towards my suffering. So basically ,we didn't need to pay a psychiatrist 600 dollors.Our psychiatrist is Nemrah. When we are depresswd we open any episode of Mala and started reading it.
                          I was always thinking that why we don't have any Dr.raid in our lives why there is no one who guides us towards light.Allah is always with you but there must be a person in our lives *Jo hmei possible solutions bataye I need anyone badly*.<br>
                          <br>Now enter deeply into my mind guys:
                          Why mala is so dheet?sometimes I think.idk why?but I think.
                          And also I think that she didn't listen maahir but he always supports him *"wo jab jab ussy bulaati hai wo jaata hai yr"*but she didn't behave well with maahir but now thank god after 19 epi her mind is out of roller coaster and she is on the right way .<br>
                          
                          <br>Butt guys don't you think it's a big *Zyaadti* with us (the readers) we get a new epi after 2_3 months .Now two episodes are left and I am thinking that mala will gave us these epi's on new year as a surprise  *"or phirr kahy gi sarf rakh laina Saath"* tab tak waisay ee soch soch k kha laini ay kisi nai
                          But this wait is worthy so much worthy than you thought .This is the book that you will never caught by a slump . I am still kind of processing everything. The book is a whirlwind of emotions, thats for sure.

<br>I mean, Kashmala, right? She is  a strong character, no doubt, but sometimes I felt like she was a little too dramatic. I get that she's going through a lot, but her decisions... well, let's just say they kept me on the edge of my seat, in a good and bad way.<br>

<br>Mahir, on the other hand, was a total sweetheart. Like, who would not  want a guy like him? But the whole love triangle thing? Come on, Nemrah, we've been there before. It was a bit predictable.

<br>The writing was good, don't get me wrong. Nemrah knows how to draw you in. But some parts dragged on a bit. I found myself skimming through a few chapters.

<br>Overall, its a decent read. If you're into emotional rollercoaster rides with a side of drama, then give it a shot. But do not  expect anything groundbreaking.</p>
